# Whales_Pred
Kaggle dataset. For the HappyWhale competition, before guessing which individual is behind a picture, we would like to see if we can guess the fin variation between family, genus and specy.  Content  In this data, from wikipedia, we retrieve infraorder, family, genus and specy for each species field detailed in the metadata of train.csv.  Notice that 3 species have only one correspondance in the taxonomy: pilot_whale, long_finned_pilot_whale and globis seems to belong to the Globicephala melas taxon. Also, 2 species are wrong spelled : bottlenose_dolpin (h is missing) and kiler_whale (l is missing). That's why there is only 26 species instead of 30. A notebook proposes a solution to join all these data.  Applications  We derived two notebooks to present this dataset:  A notebook lists all species with big pictures A notebook shows a compact table of all species
